# Overview
This week we are using SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask  databases for data storage and retrival. 

The purpose of the dataset is to look into the weather condition using these databases, to evaluate the succession of opening a business. In order to open Surf n'Shake shop in Oauhu, Hawaii, we need to impress and convince the investor(s) to be on board, and present an analysis of the weather conditions. Hopefully, positive results can persuade the investor(s) and we can have a work/life balance. 

# Results
By determining the precipitation and temperature in one year using SurfsUp_Challenge notebook, June presented a mean on 75 degrees in temperature while in December the average of temperature was 72 degrees. On the otherhand, percipatation plays in hand as well for the viability of the project.
